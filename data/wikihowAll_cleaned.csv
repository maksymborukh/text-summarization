she wants you to think she is not interested does she pay attention to you say something random to her make sure to be nice to her if her friends look at her and then you or whenever you are talking to her her friends give looks at you and raise their eyebrows this is also a good sign and if somebody says she likes you chances are she told them because she was hoping you would find out if you sit diagonal from her in class her knees or shoulders will be pointed towards you if you are sitting beside her and she has her legs crossed over and her crossed over leg is towards you this may mean that

you both have facebook accounts or something similar and she starts chatting with you within five minutes of your arrival online and this happens a few times this is a good sign if you have known her
