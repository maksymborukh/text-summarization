Pay attention to how often she starts the conversation.If initiating the conversation always falls on your shoulders, odds are, she is not very interested.,
See if she is usually the first to say goodbye.,
Count the emoticons.,
Determine how interested she is in what you have to say by her replies.If she has good, thorough responses to your comments, it shows a higher degree of interest in your thoughts and, by extension, a higher interest in you.,
Be encouraged if she starts to tease you.Texts like, ""You should be wishing you were here right now..."" or ""If you were here right now..."" are usually meant to tease you into wondering what the rest of the sentence would read, especially when they end with the ""..."" They are mildly suggestive without being too over the top, implying that she wants to get you to think about her and wonder about her feelings and intentions a little more.

Walk past him a few times during the day, without 'noticing' him.,
Smile at him once in a while, like when you walk past him or see him looking at you. 

,
Say ""Hi"" to him in the mornings.,
'Accidentally' walk into him or cross his path and nearly hit him, after pretending to be distracted by something else. 

,
Look at him and then away quickly.,
Spend time where he does, but not obsessively.,
Strike up a conversation with him about something like how much homework he is receiving.,
Flirt a little with him, like, if he told you a funny joke, giggle cutely.,
Try the distracted method.,
Be a little mysterious- don't blab everything about yourself to him in the first few conversations. 

,
If he teases you, he may like you back.,
If you think he does like you back, ask him out to a movie or lunch.,
Be different.,
Use the natural assets you have and flatter them by wearing clothes or styling your hair in a way that suits you.,
Laugh and smile a lot when he is near or if you are talking to him.,
If he compliments you and you really like him, chances are you are going to blush and smile shyly.,
Ask his friends about him openly- it will show them that you like him, and they will probably blab to him about it later.,
Be friendly and open to him.,
Do something 'absentmindedly' around him- like, if you are reading, twirl your hair or drum your fingers lightly on your seat or play with your necklace/earrings.

Before starting a conversation with him, smile when he looks at you whenever you happen to lock eyes.,
If he doesn't start a conversation with you after smiling, YOU start the talking.,

Ask about classes you both share or your opinion on teachers when confronting him.,
Remember to smile!,
Just be yourself!,

When she walks into the room and sees you she may look down as if someone said ""you have a stain on your shirt"" and she is trying to find the stain.,
If you sit next to her in class see if she glances at you.,
If she has made any note of you she'll most likely play hard to get sometimes like hardly looking at you but when she does she blushes,smiles,etc.

,
Depending on how shy she is, when she stares at you, she will either pull away very quickly or hold your gaze.,
Does she casually touch your arm while you are talking?,
Does she love to hang around with you as compared to other guys?,
Ask her friends about her crush.,
Does she include you in all her planned events?,
Well, now if she is your best friend then these signs will be normal.,
Does she compliment you?,
Does she defend you?",thats probably make sure look nice mean nervous look normally regular guy walk room wouldnt bother check doesnt look nervous dont get hope girl try hide act normal dont want know stay tune there way notice look three separate time probably like rarely look one right mean notice regular guy walk room dont think like right away mean like play hair talkinglooking maybe like big help like company best friend directly ask maybe say like deep inside like one make first move may nice person want get close well like deserve justice girl stand
"
Be yourself.,
Ask her about herself.,
Ask her a simple question.,
She'll start random conversations with you.,
If she walks by you and doesn't look at you or acknowledge you, it may be because she wants you to think she isn't interested.,
Does she pay attention to you?,
Say something random to her.,
Make sure to be nice to her.,
If her friends look at her and then you, or whenever you are talking to her, her friends give looks at you and raise their eyebrows, this is also a good sign, and if somebody says she likes you, chances are she told them because she was hoping you would find out.,
If you sit diagonal from her in class, her knees or shoulders will be pointed towards you.,
If you are sitting beside her and she has her legs crossed over and her crossed over leg is towards you this may mean that she is comfortable in your company and likes to talk to you.

,
If you're sitting behind her, she will lean back on her chair, and try to get your attention (for example, copying your habits) and will look for ways to turn around and look at you (passing an assignment back, she'll turn around and look at you).

,
Another sign that you can tell if a girl likes you is if she smiles every time you come and talk to her.

,
Ask her out and see what she says.,
If you like her, give her hints on Snapchat or Facebook, say.,
If the girl is online, chat with her a bit, then tell her you have to go.,
Notice her movements.,
Pay attention to whether she changes her posture when you enter the class.,
Here's a great hint that she likes you.,
Notice when you tease her.,
Don't talk to her best friend obsessively, as this could hint that maybe you like her best friend and that is not a good sign!,
When you're in the hallway, try to walk a couple of steps in front of her.,
If you talk to her in class and she's quiet and quick speaking, but you talk to her on the phone or something and she's all loud and not nervous, she may like you.

,
Notice when she sits by you in class.,
Get up a few times in class.,
If she looks at you and doesn't say anything, then she is waiting for you to say something to start the conversation or give a simple sign to let her know that you notice her, like a wave and smile.,
If you both have Facebook accounts or something similar and she starts chatting with you within five minutes of your arrival online, and this happens a few times, this is a good sign.,
If you have known her for a long time, then if she likes you, she will start to change her behavior, unconsciously or consciously.,
If you are friends and she goes to you with all her problems, it shows she trusts you and wants you to be part of her life.,
If you play an online game and she is your friend on the game, she might start sending you a lot of presents.,
If you make her laugh and she puts her head on your shoulder and puts her hand over yours there is a good chance she likes you.

,
If she is slouching forward with her head in her arms, or her hair is concealing her face, pay attention to which way her chair angles, and which way her face is pointing.,
If you are in lunch and she stares at you from time to time maybe smiling from here to there, she is probably into you.,
Check to see if she's flirting.,
Note!,
Tease her a little, but not too much.,
Get to know her very well then ask her out but don't say, ""Do you like me?"",
Help her out and do stuff with her!,
She stares at you.,

Keep the conversation light-hearted.Even if you're looking to make a serious romance with the girl you're talking with, you shouldn't touch upon any serious topics when you're first chatting with her.,
Invite her to do something with you.You shouldn't wait long into a conversation before asking the girl to do something fun with you.,

Decide what you want.,

Take a look at yourself and see what changes can be made.,
Listen to yourself when you talk.,
Be confident.,
Always be neat and clean with no bad boy image.,
Try to be friends with her.,
When you finally know your crush, try to attract her.,
After three or four such conversations, or till you feel that you two are pretty close, ask for her phone number, email address, etc.,
If you sense some signs that she likes you (ex: she gives you her phone number without you asking) and is more comfortable with you than any of the other guys, you might have succeeded.

,
Try to hold longer conversations with her on the phone.,
After doing all this, if the girl notices you, move to the third level.,
If she asks you about a coffee, you should not always say yes to her.,
If your crush didn't ask you out, gather up all your courage and ask her - at least try your luck instead of staying quiet.,
The next and final step, you must be alone with her and say that you want to have an important talk.,
If she doesn't feel the same way, it's okay!,
